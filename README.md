# OneKeyV2

OneKeyV2 is an upgraded version of the original OneKey tool, designed to simplify the process of unlocking Steam games using SteamTools or GreenLuma. This project is based on the original OneKey by ikun0014, but includes stability improvements, better UX, and an auto-update system.

## Features

- GitHub integration for downloading manifests and decryption keys
- Supports both SteamTools and GreenLuma
- Auto-update support (configurable)
- Console + logfile logging system
- Zero setup: `config.json` is created automatically
- SteamDB integration: shows game name & SteamDB link for the given AppID
